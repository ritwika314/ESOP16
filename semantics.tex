\label{sect:semantics}

In this section we describe the formal semantics of key language elements. 
The system consists of $N$ agents $A_1,\ldots,A_N$. The state of the overall system advances by two types of transitions: 
(a) {\em program transitions\/} correspond to agent program events updating agent variables and possibly setting waypoints for the agent's controllers. Program transitions take zero logical time.
(b) {\em environment transitions\/} 
correspond to the physical environment of the agent evolving over an interval of time. During this period, the agent platforms may be moved by their controllers, messages implementing the distributed shared memory abstraction are propagated. 
Environment transitions  are external to \rolang, and therefore, in providing an executable semantics these transitions have to be implemented by external function(s).
%
Thus, a given \rolang program may be executed with different  external functions, to obtain different executions.
% resume here.
%In doing so we use a parametrized formal semantics, where the parameters govern the intervals at which the system is observed(\refsect{exec}) and how the system evolves with respect to time(\refsect{dynamics}). Essentially, we specify the semantics of the language, provided there is a procedure to compute the physical control component of a system. 
%

In the \texttt{Race} application of \refsect{Eg}, for example, the state updates brought about by the \texttt{PickDest} and \texttt{Remove} events are program transitions and take zero logical time. In between these transitions, time may elapse and the corresponding change in the position of the agent is determined by its controller, its physical environment, etc., which are external to the program. 

%we parameterize the language semantics with the procedure for computing the positions of the robots at a given time. The event block is like the discrete step of a hybrid automaton, and the dynamic behavior is the continuous trajectory\cite{hioa}. The discrete part of the system corresponds to the programs, which interact with the physical environment using the \s{doReach} abstraction. The programs communicate with each other using shared variables.
%
%We explain this further in the following sections, starting with a description of the system state. We then describe the major features of the language semantics, including the time model and the dynamics model, which parametrize the semantics.

 \subsection{Overview of \K}
 We give the semantics of \rolang using the \K framework~\cite{rosu-serbanuta-2013-k}.
 \K is a rewriting-based executable framework for defining language semantics.
 Given a syntax and a semantics of a language, \K generates a parser, an interpreter, as well as analysis tools such as model checkers and deductive program verifiers ``for free''.
% \K also provides several formal analysis tools, which will enable us to perform formal reasoning about the language we have defined using this framework. \sayan{too vague, what are these tools? do we use them in this paper? how?}
  %This helps both in terms of applicability of the semantics and in terms of engineering the semantics itself; 
  For instance, the state-space exploration capability helps debug \rolang programs.
  For modelling interactions between agents, an appealing aspect of \K is its inherent support for non-determinism.
  Rewriting logic~\cite{meseguer2007rewriting}, makes \K suitable for reasoning about distributed systems that are  non-deterministic. 

 
 In \K, a language syntax is defined using conventional Backus-Naur Form (BNF).
 The semantics is given as a transition system, specifically, as a set of reduction rules over  configurations.
 A {\em configuration\/} is an  representation of the program code and state.
 For \rolang, a configuration represents the code and the program state for all the agent, as well as the state of the physical environment (see Figure~\ref{fig:arch}). 
 Components or members of a configuration are called {\em cells.}
 The notation $\kall{cellname}{celltype}$  
 represents a cell called $\mathit{cellname}$
 with a value of type ${\sf celltype}$.
% 
 A special cell, named \s{k}, contains a list of computation to be executed.
 Cells may be nested, that is, contain other cells. 
 %A {\em computation\/} is a program fragment, while the original program is flattened into a sequence of computations or programming tasks.
 %
 
A {\em rewrite rule\/} describes a one-step transition between configurations.  For example,the following is a lookup rule. 
%\begin{figure}[h!]
%\label{fig:krule}
%\centering
The horizontal line represents a rewrite from previous term (above) to result(below). Cells without a rewrite, such as
$\kall{memory}{X \mapsto V}$, are read, but not changed by the rewrite.  The ellipsis ($\cdots$)  matches the portions of a cell that are neither read nor written by the rule.
%
\vspace{0.25cm}
\krule[lookup]{
 \kprefix{k}{\reduce{\variable{X}}{\variable{V}}} \mathrel{}
  \kmiddle{memory}{\variable{X} \mapsto \variable{V}} \mathrel{}
  }{}{}{}{}
%\end{figure}
%
\noindent
This rule is applied when the current computation is a look-up expression \w{X}; \w{X} is mapped to  a value \w{V} in  \s{memory}. The rule rewrites   \w{X} to \w{V}.
 
 


\subsection{Agent Cells and System Configuration}
%The configuration holds program variables, objects, environment variable, and the execution context. 
%We omit implementation minutiae, and only show relevant features. 
%
Each agent has an \s{agent} cell which stores the program variables of the agent, its execution context, as well as environment variables that are relevant for the agent such as the agent's position.  The \s{agent} cell consists of the following cells.
%For instance, a cell maintaining the \s{position} of an agent, which has type \verb|ItemPosition| will be represented as $\langle {\verb|ItemPosition|} \rangle_{\s{position}}$. Cells can also be composite cells, or containers of other cells. 
%They will just be denoted by $\langle\mbox{cell-contents}\rangle_{\mbox{cell-name}}$.  
%
%Each agent is represented by a composite cell, because the code is executed at agent level, and requires agent-specific information. An \s{agent} is identified by a unique identifier \s{id} (which is an integer). Its configuration contains the following cells. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item  \s{k}: agent's own application code
 %Each line in this cell is rewritten (possibly to empty) as the semantics is executed.
 \item \s{id}: agent's unique integer identifier 
 \item \s{memory}: a map from agent's program variables to addresses
 \item  \s{position}: agent's current position in space in common coordinates 
 \item  \s{counter}: counts the number of times the agent's event block has executed
 \item \s{lockState}: Denotes whether or not the agent holds the requested lock.
 \sayan{confused about the type idle}
\end{itemize}
\input{configuration2.tex}
%
The \s{memory} cell maps  \emph{all}---local and shared---variable names to addresses (of type \s{Int}). That is,  the agent's memory actually has copies of the shared variables.
The \s{position} cell is specific to agents programs that rely on positional sensors. Other cells for different sensors can be included as well. 
We will discuss how shared variables reads and writes update the local copies and the related consistency models in~\refsect{shared-consist}. 
We will discuss locking in~\refsect{locking}. 

  
The top-level system configuration cell is called  \s{system} (Figure~\ref{fig:highlevelconfig}; it consists of the  following main cells:
\begin{itemize}
\item \s{agents}: contain $N$ \s{agent} cells. \sayan{why *?lets fix $N$ as the number of agents.}
\item \s{gMemory}: maps all shared variables to addresses in the memory 
\item \s{MMap}:a map from memory addresses  to variable values  
\item  \s{time}: global time elapsed 
\item \s{counterMap}: map of agent \s{ids} to their \emph{counter} (\refsect{exec}) values
%We explain what that refers to, in the next paragraph. 
\item  \s{lockQueue}: maintains the order of lock requests
\item \s{transitionState}: indicates whether or not \sayan{environment transitions} are being executed.  
\end{itemize}
\input{configuration1.tex}
The next subsections describe the semantics of \rolang in terms of rewriting rules for  \s{system} configurations. 

\subsection[h]{Local Variable Declaration}
A statement:
\begin{lstlisting}
local T x;
\end{lstlisting}	
declares a local variable called \s{x} of type \s{T}.
The following rewriting rule captures local variable declaration. It creates (a) an entry in the \s{memory} cell, that maps the variable name \s{x} a free address in  \s{MMap} and (b) an entry in the \s{MMap} cell, that  maps the aforementioned address to an \s{undefined} value, and (c) the line of code with the declaration is rewritten to empty($\dotCt{}$). 
Shared variable declarations are  processed  similarly, except, that a copy of the variable is stored both at the global memory \s{gMemory} and at each agent's memory.

\subsection[h]{Events and Time Advancement}
\label{sect:exec}

The \s{time} cell models real-time  of the system and it advances when the environment transitions occur. The program transitions (events) take zero time. In general, \rolang programs can produce zeno behavior whereby arbitrarily many program transitions occur at the same real-time. The \K formalization for \rolang enables us to control the executable semantics with the following two parameters:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item $\delta$: time elapsed over a single environment transitions 
 \item $n_0$: maximum number of instantaneous program transitions per agent.
 \end{itemize}
  The \s{counter} and \s{counterMap} cells in the system configuration ensure that each event block can execute at most ${n_0}$ times, before a environment transition occurs. 
 
Consider an event block \s{pre(C); eff : S Es} where \s{S} is a list of statements, and \s{Es} is the list of events following the first event. If \s{C} holds then the first event rewrites to \s{S}, else it  rewrites to \s{Es}.  
After an event occurs, the agent's \s{counter} is incremented and if the it is less than $n_0$ then the event block starts executing from the top again.

\input{time1.tex}.
%\input{time.tex}. 

	%Let \s{counterMap} cell, which maintains a map of ids to counter values of all agents contain a map $CM$. \s{findMax} and \s{findMin} are functions for computing the maximum and minimum in the range of a map respectively. If both the minimum and maximum values are equal, then all values in the range of the map are equal. 
	The \s{time advance} transition advances global time from  $T$ to $T+\delta$. The \s{transitionState} is set to \verb|dynamic| from \verb|discrete|. 
	%
	\sayan{I pulled this para from the section on doReach avoid. Somehow we need to talk about updating the continuous variables.}
	We then invoke the external function \s{doReachBB} to compute the new contents of the \s{position} cell of each agent at time $T_0 +\delta$, given that the position of the agent at time $T_0$ was $P$, the target \s{ItemPosition} is $T$, obstacles were stored in $O$, and the time increment was $\delta$. We omit the details of maintaining $T_0$, $O$ and $T$.
%	
%	We do not show the rest of the configuration items because they do not appear in the condition or change with the time progression rule. 
%It is worth mentioning that while we designed the time progression such that the event block executes exactly $n_0$ number of times for each agent, we can easily change the design to accommodate different values for different agents. 
%To do that, we modify the time model by adding another parameter $\rho$ to it. $\rho$ is a map from agent \s{ids} to integers. Instead of incrementing the counter by one every time an event occurs, agent with it $i$ increments its counter by $\rho[i]$. The number of times its event block executes is then $\floor{\frac{n_0}{\rho[i]}}$.


\subsection[h]{Locking}
\label{sect:locking}
We provide global locks to implement mutual exclusion for the atomic construct. 
	These locks have two major properties:
    \begin{itemize}
\item At any time, at most one agent can hold a lock. 
\item A agent needs to request a lock at most once before being eventually granted the lock. 
\end{itemize}
The first property ensures mutual exclusion and the second ensures that high frequency agents do not monopolize the lock. 
While defining the semantics it is easier for us to present the rules in terms of a single global lock on all $\MW$ shared variables. 

Each agent has a cell called \s{lockState}, which is set to \s{idle} if the agent is not requesting or holding the lock, \s{request} if the agent has requested the lock but not been granted it yet, and \s{lock} if the agent is currently holding the lock. We maintain the lock queue or the order in which requests to the lock were made by agents, in the cell \s{lockQueue}. 

When an agent requests a lock, its \s{id} is added at the end of the \s{lockQueue} An agent which has requested a lock, is granted it if it is the first in the lock queue. Once an agent has requested a lock, its \s{lockState} is updated to \s{request}. An agent is not allowed to add itself to the \s{lockQueue} unless its \s{lockState} is \s{idle}. When the agent is at the beginning of the \s{lockQueue} and its \s{lockState} is \s{request}, then it can execute its atomic block. Once it has done so, it updates its \s{lockState} to \s{idle} again, and removes itself from the \s{lockQueue}. 

An agent must be in the process of executing the effect of an event when it might need to request a lock. It is however, not allowed to execute the next line of code until it is granted the lock and can proceed. We force the \s{counter} to be incremented every time the agent checks its position in the \s{lockQueue}. The reason for this is to capture behavior where the lock may not be granted immediately. Since the event block execution takes zero logical time, if the counters were not incremented while the agents were requesting a lock, all locks would be granted before \s{time} was incremented from the current value. This would then imply that all locks are granted while zero logical time passed, which is unrealistic. We provide the rewrite rules governing locking below, again, given a time model $\tau = (\delta,n_0)$. 

\paragraph{Lock Request Transition:} The \s{lock request} transition is enabled when an agent with \s{id} \s{i}, encounters an atomic block containing statements \s{Ss}, when its \s{lockstate} is \s{idle}. Then, the agent adds a marker \s{atomicEnd} just after the atomic block, to ensure that the agent releases the lock after executing it. At the same time, the agent adds itself to the end of the lock queue. The ellipses represent the fact that the lock queue may or may not be empty, it doesn't affect the application of the current rule. Again, we omit showing the irrelevant cells in this rule. 
\input{locking1.tex}
\paragraph{Atomic Wait Transition:} We capture the fact that locks may not be granted immediately by enabling counter increments when the \s{lockState} is \s{request} and the agent \s{id} is not at the head of the \s{lockQueue}. The rewrite rules in the semantics can fire whenever they are enabled, which means that this might result in an agent just continually incrementing its counter, and never doing anything else; thus simulating a failed or crashed agent. 
\input{locking2.tex}
\paragraph{Atomic Execution Transition:} The agent aquires the lock when it is at the beginning of the \s{lockQueue} and starts processing the statements inside the atomic block. The \s{counter} does not increase in this rewrite, because once the lock has been acquired, the agent can immediately execute the atomic block. 
\input{locking3.tex}
\paragraph{Lock Release Transition}
Once the atomic block has been executed, the lock must be released, the agent must take itself out of the \s{lockQueue}, and set its own \s{lockState} to \s{idle}. The rest of the event continues to execute. Recall that in the lock request transition, we added a terminal \s{atomicEnd} after the atomic block. We can now use that to identify where the atomic block ends. 
\input{locking4.tex}
\input{dynamics.tex}

\subsection{Consistency}
. In an implementation of this language that runs on actual distributed agents, shared variables would be implemented through message passing. Depending on the message protocol used, there can be different consistency models, so it becomes necessary to discuss the consistency model that our semantics follows. To do so, we first need to discuss the semantics  of the variable lookup and assignment. In the system configuration, each the \s{agent} cell contains its own \s{memory}, and there is a global memory (\s{gMemory}). Each agent maintains a copy of the shared variables, which are also stored in the global memory. When an agent writes to a variable, it updates its local copy, and the local copy. The local copies of other agents are unchanged. The local copies of all agents are updated after a time increment has occurred, and before the next round of program transitions begins. When a variable is read, only the local copy is read. This might result in agents using older copies of variables during a program transition.

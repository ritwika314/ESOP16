\subsection{The \StarL robotics framework}
We are developing \rolang to interface with the Stabilizing Robotics Language (\StarL). 
\StarL is primarily in Java, and it provides language constructs for coordination and control
across robots.Two key features of \StarL are a distributed shared memory (DSM) primitive
for coordination and a reach-avoid primitive for control. DSM allows a
program to declare program variables that are shared across multiple robots
. This enables programs running on different
robots to communicate by writing-to and reading from the shared variable.

All the program threads implementing the application, the message channels,
as well as the physical environment of the application (robot chassis, obstacles)
are modelled as hybrid automata, and the overall system is described
by a giant composition of these automata.

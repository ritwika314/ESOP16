	virtual layer consisting of mobile client nodes, stationary Virtual
	Nodes (VNs), and local broadcast communication. The VNs are associated
	with predetermined regions in the plane and coordinate among themselves
	to distribute the client nodes relatively uniformly among the VNs�
	regions. Each VN directs its local client nodes to align themselves
	on the local portion of the target curve. The resulting motion coordination
	protocol is self-stabilizing, in that each robot can begin the execution
	in any arbitrary state and at any arbitrary location in the plane.
	In addition, self-stabilization ensures that the robots can adapt
	to changes in the desired target formation.},

	Safe flocking in Euclidean spaces is a well-studied and difficult
	coordination problem. In this paper, we study one-dimensional safe
	flocking in the presence of actuator faults and directional failure
	detectors (DFDs). Actuator faults cause affected agents to move permanently
	with arbitrary velocities, and DFDs detect failures only when actuation
	and required motion are in opposing directions. First, assuming existence
	of a DFD for actuator faults, we present an algorithm for safe flocking.
	Next, we show that certain actuator faults cannot be detected with
	DFDs, while detecting others requires time that grows linearly with
	the number of participating agents. Finally, we show that our DFD
	algorithm achieves the latter bound.},

	Inevitability captures various common liveness properties. In this

	Hybrid Automata (LHA). The algorithm combines (a) Lyapunov function-based
	relational abstractions for the continuous dynamics with (b) automated
	construction of well-founded relations for the loops of the hybrid
	automaton. The algorithm is complete for automata that are symmetric
	with respect to the chosen Lyapunov functions. The algorithm is implemented
	in a prototype tool (LySHA ) which is integrated with a Simulink/Stateflow
	frontend for modeling hybrid systems. The experimental results demonstrate
	the effectiveness of the methodology in verifying inevitability of
	hybrid automata with up to five continuous dimensions and forty locations.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement
	procedure for verifying stability (region stabillity) of CPS modeled
	as hybrid automata. It relies on a characterization of the blocking
	property of hybrid automata in terms of well-foundedness of a relation
	that combines the discrete transitions and continuous trajectories
	and a key assumption about the switching speed of the system in terms
	of average dwell time, but does not require the individual modes
	to be stable. This characterization enables the adaptation of program
	analysis techniques to the domain of hybrid systems. It is shown
	that the procedure is complete for rectangular initialized hybrid
	automata. Several illustrative examples are verified using a prototype
	tool that implements the methodology},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Rectangular hybrid automata (RHA) are finite state machines with additional
	skewed clocks that are useful for modeling real-time systems. This
	paper is concerned with the uniform verification of safety properties
	of networks with arbitrarily many interacting RHAs. Each automaton
	is equipped with a finite collection of pointers to other automata
	that enables it to read their state. This paper presents a small
	model result for such networks that reduces the verification problem
	for a system with arbitrarily many processes to a system with finitely
	many processes. The result is applied to verify and discover counter-examples
	of inductive invariant properties of distributed protocols, such
	as Fischer's mutual exclusion algorithm, the Small Aircraft Transportation
	System (SATS) protocol, and a one-dimensional flocking protocol.
	We have implemented a prototype tool called PASSEL relying on the
	satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver Z3 to check automatically
	key inductive invariants.},

This class of properties subsume bounded safety and capture requirements about visiting a sequence of predicates within given time intervals.  Our algorithm handles nonlinear predicates that arise from dynamics-based predictions used in alerting protocols for state-of-the-art transportation systems. It is sound and relatively complete for nonlinear switch systems that robustly satisfy the given property. The algorithm is implemented in our Compare Execute Check Engine (C2E2) using validated simulations. As a case study, we consider NASA's Adjacent Landing Alerting System (ALAS), which is an alerting protocol for closely spaced parallel runways.Using our approach, we study the performance of the ALAS protocol with respect to false and missed alerts for different operating conditions such as initial velocities, bankangles, initial longitudinal separation, and runway configurations.},

  abstract = {Motor transmission-based drive systems are attractive for electric vehicles but, as the motor is directly connected to the transmission shaft which meshes with the gears, controlling gear shifts is challenging. In this paper, we present a methodology for synthesis and verification of open-loop optimal control of the electric motor in a motor-transmission drive system. The key steps in  this methodology are (a) developing a continuous-time model of the trajectory of the sleeve during the meshing process based on appropriate coefficients of restitution, (b) discrete-time controller synthesis for finitely many initial states using model predictive control (MPC) and (c) verification of the synthesized controller for a higher-fidelity continuous time hybrid automaton model. First, we develop a model of the motor-transmission drive system as a continuous-time hybrid automaton (CHA) with uncertain initial states. Next, this model is transformed to a piece-wise affine (PWA) form for solving an optimal control problem using the multi-parametric toolbox. Finally, the delay bound for the synthesized controller is verified  by computing a bounded time over-approximation of the reach set using an existing algorithm for linear deterministic hybrid automata. Our results show that on an average our synthesized controller can shorten the meshing duration by 71.05% and reduce impacts impulse by 85.72% compared to an existing controller and the sleeve can mesh with the gear within a desired time from every initial state.},

	larger nonlinear dynamical system A which bounds the distance between
	two (possibly diverging) trajectories of $A_i$ in terms of their
	initial states and inputs. Using the IS discrepancy functions, we
	construct a low dimensional deterministic dynamical system M(\delta).
	For any two trajectories of $A$ starting $\delta$ distance apart,
	we show that one of them bloated by a factor determined by the trajectory
	of $M$ contains the other. Further, by choosing appropriately small
	$\delta$'s the overapproximations computed by the above method can
	be made arbitrarily precise. Using the above results we develop a

	of a distributed control system. But, sharing may also violate privacy.
	We develop a general framework for studying the cost of differential
	privacy in systems where a collection of agents, with coupled dynamics,
	communicate for sensing their shared environment while pursuing individual
	preferences. First, we propose a communication strategy that relies
	on adding carefully chosen random noise to agent states and show
	that it preserves differential privacy. Of course, the higher the
	standard deviation of the noise, the higher the cost of privacy.
	For linear distributed control systems with quadratic cost functions,
	the standard deviation becomes independent of the number agents and
	it decays with the maximum eigenvalue of the dynamics matrix. Furthermore,
	for stable dynamics, the noise to be added is independent of the
	number of agents as well as the time horizon up to which privacy
	is desired. Finally, we show that the cost of $\epsilon$-differential
	privacy up to time $T$, for a stable system with $N$ agents, is upper
	bounded by $O(\frac{T^3}{ N \epsilon^2})$.},

	systems can be scaled up by employing simulation-guided
	reach set over-approximation techniques. Existing methods
	are either applicable to only restricted classes of systems,
	overly conservative, or computationally expensive. We
	present new techniques to compute a locally optimal bloating
	factor based on discrepancy functions, which allow construction
	of reach set over-approximations from simulation
	traces for general nonlinear systems. The discrepancy functions
	are critical for tools like C2E2 to verify bounded time
	safety properties for complex hybrid systems with nonlinear
	continuous dynamics. The new discrepancy function is
	computed using local bounds on a matrix measure under
	an optimal metric such that the exponential change rate of
	the discrepancy function is minimized. The new technique is
	less time consuming and less conservative than existing techniques
	and does not incur significant computational overhead.
	We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
	comparing the performance of a prototype implementation
	with the state-of-the-art reachability analysis tool Flow*.},

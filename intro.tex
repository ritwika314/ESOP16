\section{Introduction}
Distributed robotics and control systems have applications in manufacturing, transportation, and exploration. Managing and programming ...

% with distributed dynamic platforms is a
%non-trivial task, mostly requiring a expertise of the programming language in which the application is implemented, and the hardware platform on which the framework is built. Typically, deployment and testing of a new algorithm might take a long time for even experienced programmer.  If one wanted to test an existing application different dynamics models, or a new platform, or heterogeneous agents, it could jeopardize time sensitive deployment programs.  Considerably less effort is needed to perform this type of task with desktop (or mobile) applications. The lack of an accepted standard, and abstractions for specific applications makes experiments are costly to repeat and verify. 

%With this in mind, we introduce a domain specific language which allows users to design distributed dynamic applications without implementing low-level communication protocols and dynamics models. We provide a clean precondition-effect style of programming, similar to the representation of Hybrid Input-Output Automata as in~\cite{lynch1996hybrid}. HIOA is a mathematical framework for precisely describing
%systems that have both discrete and continuous dynamics. We also provide a shared memory abstraction to the users with various levels of access, which 
%We provide several abstractions to the user for communication and dynamic behavior while hiding the details of the implementation which is captured by the semantics we present in this paper. The work in this paper presents a formal semantics that reflects the implementation goals for this language.

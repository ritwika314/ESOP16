\begin{abstract}
We describe the design of \rolang, a language for writing distributed applications with dynamic behavior. \rolang allows the programmer to write application code, which involves communication between agents using shared memory, and interaction with physical environment using time varying system variables, in a clean and precondition-effect style representation. \rolang also serves as a high level language for the StarL robotic 	 framework. 
We provide an executable formal semantics for \rolang using the $\mathbb{K}$ semantic framework. We use the notion of a parametrized semantics, where the dynamics of the system is governed by an external model. We also provide a time model and discuss communication through shared memory. We then use this \rolang to write various distributed applications and explore their behavior in the executable semantics implemented in $\mathbb{K}$.

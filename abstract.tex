\begin{abstract}
We describe the design of physical coordination and control language (PCCL) for writing distributed programs that control physical processes such as robots and mobile agents. The key features of this  event-based language includes a  distributed shared memory abstraction for coordination and a reach-avoid abstraction for controlling the motion. 
In this paper we present, the executable formal semantics using the $\mathbb{K}$ framework. As a given \rolang program can interact with different physical environments through different sensors and actuators, the executable semantics is parametrized by the dynamics of the program's environment.
% We also provide a time model and discuss communication through shared memory. 
With illustrative examples we show how  the language can help develop portable distributed applications. The K?? enables state space exploration and can help find subtle bugs.
